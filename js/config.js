    bio: "Welcome to my digital universe where curiosity drives innovation and creativity knows no bounds. I'm a high school student who thinks like a researcher, codes like a craftsman, and creates music that tells stories.",
    description: "Fueled by curiosity (and way too much coffee â˜•), I live at the intersection of science, technology, and creative expression. I approach problems with first principles thinking, always asking 'why' before 'how.' Whether I'm diving deep into compression algorithms, building productivity tools, or producing my next track, I'm constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible.",
    currentFocus: "Currently exploring the fascinating world of machine learning and AGI research. I've been diving deep into transformer architectures and recently started venturing into neuroscience to understand how biological intelligence works. My goal? To bridge the gap between artificial and human intelligence while creating tools that actually make people's lives better.",
